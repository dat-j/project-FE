## Full-time Work

**Thinkdiff JSC** (Jan 2024 - May 2024)

My first work is internship at Thinkdiff. At Thinkdiff, I do many types of work, such as developing mobile, and web applications.

However, my work there is primarily focused on web development, and around the last 5 months I worked there, I have learned a lot about React, particularly when creating the v2 design editor.
